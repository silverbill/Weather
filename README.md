# Weather

The Weather app has zero error handling characteristics so be careful!  To return your local weather, forcast, and sunrise and set times, all that 
is required is the input of a 5 digit zip code, no more, no less.  

Weather makes use of Google Maps and Dark Sky APIs to present this information.
